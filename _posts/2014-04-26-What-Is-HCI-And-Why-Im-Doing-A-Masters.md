#ROUGH DRAFT

##What Is HCI

Human Computer Interaction is the study of how humans and computers interact so that humans can use computers better. I'm doing a masters from Georgia Institute of Technology. A link to the course can be found [http://mshci.gatech.edu/](here)
 
HCI is a field that's been developing for a few years. Instead of focusing on how to engineer new technologies it focuses on how to use the current technology to produce more useful stuff instead.

##HCI in Georgia Tech
In Georgia Tech. Its headed up by 4 schools:

* Industrial Design
* Interactive Computing
* Literature, Media and Communication (LMC)
* Psychology.

The reason for this is the nature of the subject. It requires an interdisciplanary approach to the subject.

The reasons for this are HCI is not like Computer Science. Its not about developing a cool solution. Its about making solutions useable. The reason I'm doing it is because frankly 80% of cool stuff today was reseached about 10 years ago. It takes so long to come to the consumer shelf that we are bored by the time we get it.

Look at Facebook. We had the technology to build that 20 years ago. People were already doing it in colleges or locally 15 years ago. But, it took someone with a great implementation to create.

Same goes for Google. The PageRank algorithm was not so incredibly special. It was the fact that it was a search engine that only searched. Something that Yahoo! and other competitors had ceased to be.

HCI, I believe can make me understand the how to take reasearch ideas and technology and make them actually useful stuff.
