I'm curious about how to organize my blog. Its a curious question. I'd lke to think that the things I blog about blur lines between topics. They're never talking about one particular subject or another.

The major organizational paradigm that has been around for a while is tags. There are a lot of reasons for tags. They are:

1. Easy to handle. Anyone can type them or describe stuff with them
2. Super duper flexible
3. Will help machines sort out your article a lot faster. (Woohoo, Semantic Web)

The second major organizational paradigm is categories. The difference between a tag and a category is:

1. Where tags are flexible categories are usually rigid and articles are written to fit them
2. Categories are mainly used for browsing a website once you land on the main page. Conversely, tags are more conducive to searching


But I've been wondering recently about how to use tags effectively to actually arrange my blog well. So how do I use both these paradigms to help me nicely display a motley collection of articles. Here is what I need:

1. A solution that will let me harness tags for searching but not leave them as broadly unexplained as tags tend to be.
2. A solution where users can use the tags to browse not search. As in it should be as conducive to browsing as categories are without forcing articles to be in one categoru.
