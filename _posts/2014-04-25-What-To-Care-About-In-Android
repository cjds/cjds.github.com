I've spent the last few days coming back to android after a two year break. It seems almost surprising how little it changed.
So, I'm designing an android game which will be on the market soon. It took me about a day to finish the basic programming. 
I've spent the next 3 weeks changing and improving the design. 

I just thought I'd write a few things that occurred to me in the process of making this app.


1. The Pause States
Handle all the pause states.
onPause onResume onDestroy everuthimg. Its annoying when you use the phone proplerlu and the app.doesn't seem to respond

2. Font And Colour
Too many apps stick to the default font. That font could is different for different phones. Its best if.you have a uniform font that everyone likes


3. Uniformity is a Beautiful Thing
Most apps have uniformity just like most.websites. but sometimes you run across an app.thats so incongruously connected that it makes you wonder why the designer did so many random things


4. Sound, Animation: Only include it if its worth it

Sounds, animation etc. Frankly though animation can feel good if used well I've never.understood.sound
Tons of websites run fine without it.
Its believe sound should be used for.getting the users attention. Not just for everything in the app


5. Design Everything
Do I really need to explain
