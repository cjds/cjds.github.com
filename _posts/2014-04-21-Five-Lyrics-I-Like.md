Lyrics are the blah blah blah.

Randomly today I thought I'd write about lyrics. Music is a really subjective subject so if you disagree with me write your own list in the comments. Every one of these lyrics had stories attached. Or at least reasons why they were written. Maybe I'm  a sap but I believe that makes each song worth listening to.

I'm not contending these are the best lyrics ever written or even close to them I'm just saying the lyrics of these songs are pretty cool.


Blowin' In The Wind - Bob Dylan


The answer my friend is blowing in the wind.
Imagine - John Lennon

In My Life - The Beatles (so John Lennon)

Vincent - Don McLean

Roll The Dice - Koufax
