##What is it
Red is a new programming language with an ambitious goal. 
Its a new kid on the block being born only in 2011. However it promises  some features that i(f it can deliver) will be incredible for the future of programming.

Red touts itself as what is known as a full stack language. Full stack language from the microprocessor upwards. 
This means that one can technically use Red to build an `exe` in any platform, to make an Android app, to make Javascript code for your web pages or to program your Raspberry Pi.

The project is ambitious to say the least. 

##What's Cool about it
Imageine programming in one language. You are programming a website. Imagine writing everything from your database queries to your GUI in one language. Imagine teaching kids one language which they can use to make software or mess with hardware. Red is incredibly useful.
