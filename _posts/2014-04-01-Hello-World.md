Hello World.

I'm an Indian programmer who lives in Mumbai. 

I'm interested in programming and designing. Specifically I program in  Java, Javascript & PHP and design in Photoshop. I have a penchant for artificial intelligence and data mining.

I've wanted to write a blog for sometime and decided to finally get around to doing it. I'm going to try to write one post every day for the next 45 days. 

Dates: **April 1, 2014** to **May 15,2014**
