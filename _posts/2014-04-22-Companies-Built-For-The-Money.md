##The Big Boys Of Tech

Microsoft, Google, Apple, Yahoo, Facebook. These names are syonymous with technology culture. Their logos are etched in nearly every device we touch. 

Oculus, Tumblr, Instagram, Skype, Android. All of these were once part of the great throng of startups that seems to pervade our culture. All of them have been bought by the big boys listed above. This throng of startups is creating a new generation of entrprneurs. Entrepreuners where the dream has been relegated from "lets be a big company" to "lets be bought by a big company".

##So, What's The Problem With That

We live in an age where Computer startups just need a couple of laptops and a few hard working people. Unfortunately, even then our younger visionaries seem not to dream as big as they could. There are a new breed of startups ride on the popularity of one app until their swallowed by bigger fish.

Yahoo for example bought a startup called Summly in 2011. Summly was powered by an 8 man team and used to summarize news articles for people to read. It was headed by 18 year old Nick __________ 	. They paid $30 million for it. At that price they could have gotten 30 researchers who were brilliant in Natural Language Processing. Instead they got a kid that just used the tools that those experts created. I'm not impigning on his brilliance. I'm trying to say that the buy defied the logic of shoring up they're news division. Here's an article that goes into detail on the subject.

Companies snap up startups at an unprecedented rate.
They buy over the little guy. 

Its David vs. Goliath except David puts down his slingshot for a Goliath size bag of money.

In every industry the little guy is destroyed by larger conglomerates.

However, this trend is really devastating to the ability of people to innovate.

People are creating companies that sell out. Literally building companies that focus on doing that. Companies like FourSquare think nowhere post they're one product. They're looking shocked by the fact they haven't been snapped up by any of the big boys yet.

Companies used to be built for beating the man. For tearing down the institutions that exist. Shaking them up and challenging them.


##Lets put some stats up
In 2013 alone between Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo there were 75 startups bought that have been on record. So far in 2014 its 23 (uptil March '14). These 4 alone are buying a startup every 3 days.

Sometimes these acquisitions defy logic. Google, for example, wanted to start to up their robotics division in more earnest. In December last year over a period of 10 days, they acquired 9 startups. And they continued by buying Boston Dynamics at the beginning of this year.


##An Open Ended End.
Maybe the next set of visionaries is out on the horizon. Sitting in laboratories or classrooms today.
