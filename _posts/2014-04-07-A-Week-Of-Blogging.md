I've been blogging every day for a week now, and have consequently found out a few things.

>1. Writing an article is hard. Even if you know the subject matter, translating it into an explanation that everyone can understand takes ages.
2. It takes a lot longer than I thought to write a post. I thought writing a post might take an hour. Its more like three. 
3. CSS is annoying. Being a perfectionist, setting up the CSS for the blog took at least half of my time. (even though I know it looks like I've done nothing)

Also blogging seems to be more as much about reading as it is about writing. Each post forced me to read a ton of other articles and documentation to check that my information was correct.

Among these,

* [A Geek With A Hat (Swizec Teller)](http://www.swizec.com) is a great blog by a programmer from Slovakia. His articles are generally mix of technical and non-technical. He's challenged himself to understand one academic paper every week for 52 weeks. You can read more about the challenge here.

* The Knicker API's creator [Jeremy Brooks](http://www.jeremybrooks.net) writes a blog here. His work on a Flickr API is also worth a look at. 

* Java SE 8 released on March 19. This fact was absolutely unbeknown to me until I read [this delightful article](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2109224/core-java/java-8-officially-arrives-at-last.html) about the new features it incorporates. (I also was reading about [Project Jigsaw](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2078598/java-se/project-jigsaw-delayed-until-java-9.html) and Java SE 9)

* [Mkyong](http://www.mkyong.com/) is an old popular programmers blog for and by programmers. Learned a lot from there for my article about Maven. But he is a great resource about a lot of things.

* I also read [this brilliant article](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.in/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html) describing the flaws in the Java Method of programming. Its length is worth it. :-)

* Also for my work on a Song in Pictures I was inspired by Luke Beard's project, [A Lyric A Day](http://www.alyricaday.com).
