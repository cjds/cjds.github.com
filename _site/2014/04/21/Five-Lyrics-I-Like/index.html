<h1>5 Lyrics I Like</h1>

<hr>


<p><em>"One good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain. ~ Bob Marley"</em></p>

<p>Randomly today I thought I'd write about lyrics. Music is a really subjective subject so if you disagree with me write your own list in the comments. Every one of these lyrics had stories attached. Or at least reasons why they were written. I believe that makes each song worth listening to.</p>

<p>I'm not contending these are the best lyrics ever written or even close to them I'm just saying the lyrics of these songs are pretty cool.</p>

<h3>April Come She Will - Simon &amp; Garfunkel</h3>

<p>The contender for this spot was Time by Pink Floyd. Both these songs have immensely similar themes though Time is far more well known. But I love the mellow guitar that plays in April Come She Will. For some reason it reminds me of passing time far more than ticking clocks</p>

<h3>Imagine - John Lennon</h3>

<p><em>You may say I'm a dreamer</em> lets hope I'm not the only one</p>

<h3>In My Life - The Beatles (so John Lennon)</h3>

<p>In My Life was always about reminiscing. Whenever I think of the way things were or how things seemed in the past I think of it. Always reminds me that <em>I know I'll never lose affection, For people and things that went before, I know I'll often stop and think about them, In my life I love you more.</em></p>

<h3>Roll The Dice - Koufax</h3>

<p>This is the least famous song on the list but with some absolutely astounding lyrics. The lyrics though speak for themselves.
From they're opening reference to George Orwell's 1985 ( <em>Eric Blair was right ..</em> ) to the last verse discussing Jean Paul Sartre ( <em>a thinking man chose to pass up a Nobel Prize</em>) this song is a masterpiece in poetry.</p>

<p>If you listen carefully this song will cause you to question institutionalism in a fundamental way.</p>

<h3>Blowin' In The Wind - Bob Dylan</h3>

<p>I won't bother talking about this one. I'll let Bob Dylan do it</p>

<blockquote><p>There ain't too much I can say about this song except that the answer is blowing in the wind. It ain't in no book or movie or TV show or discussion group. Man, it's in the wind ...just like a restless piece of paper it's got to come down some  ...But the only trouble is that no one picks up the answer when it comes down so not too many people get to see and know</p></blockquote>
