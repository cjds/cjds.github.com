<h1>What is HCI and Why I'm doing a Masters in it.</h1>

<hr>
<h1>ROUGH DRAFT</h1>

<h2>What Is HCI</h2>

<p>Human Computer Interaction is the study of how humans and computers interact so that humans can use computers better. I'm doing a masters from Georgia Institute of Technology. A link to the course can be found <a href="here">http://mshci.gatech.edu/</a></p>

<p>HCI is a field that's been developing for a few years. Instead of focusing on how to engineer new technologies it focuses on how to use the current technology to produce more useful stuff instead.</p>

<h2>HCI in Georgia Tech</h2>

<p>In Georgia Tech. Its headed up by 4 schools:</p>

<ul>
<li>Industrial Design</li>
<li>Interactive Computing</li>
<li>Literature, Media and Communication (LMC)</li>
<li>Psychology.</li>
</ul>


<p>The reason for this is the nature of the subject. It requires an interdisciplanary approach to the subject.</p>

<p>The reasons for this are HCI is not like Computer Science. Its not about developing a cool solution. Its about making solutions useable. The reason I'm doing it is because frankly 80% of cool stuff today was reseached about 10 years ago. It takes so long to come to the consumer shelf that we are bored by the time we get it.</p>

<p>Look at Facebook. We had the technology to build that 20 years ago. People were already doing it in colleges or locally 15 years ago. But, it took someone with a great implementation to create.</p>

<p>Same goes for Google. The PageRank algorithm was not so incredibly special. It was the fact that it was a search engine that only searched. Something that Yahoo! and other competitors had ceased to be.</p>

<p>HCI, I believe can make me understand the how to take reasearch ideas and technology and make them actually useful stuff.</p>
