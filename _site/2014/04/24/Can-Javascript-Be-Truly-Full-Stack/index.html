<h1>Can Javascript Be A Truly Full Stack Language</h1>

<hr>
<h2>What is A Full Stack Language</h2>

<p>I've been looking recently at languages and how they come to be.</p>

<p>In 2011 a language called Red was started as a project.
They defined themselves as a full stack language. One language for web development, coding, applications right down to microprocessors.</p>

<p>They so wanted their language to be homionic, weakly typed and friendly to beginners.</p>

<p>That's quite a challenge.</p>

<p>3 years and a lot of work gave produced a language that's insightful and in depth, redefining the way we may program. Their still far from done though</p>

<p>Recently I was wondering why we can't do what Red is attempting with JavaScript.</p>

<h2>The benefits of using Javascript as Full Stack</h2>

<p>JavaScript is</p>

<ol>
<li>Well known. So no problem about being familiar</li>
<li>Already full stack because of concepts like Node.js which allow you to create applications.</li>
<li>Already has a good stricture and programming logic. It is functional and kind of homionic</li>
</ol>


<h2>Did I Say Already Full Stack</h2>

<p>NodeJS was developed to allow programmers to write Javascript Applications for the server. With the proliferation of scripts that do a ton of things NodeJS can officially be used across the entire Stack.</p>

<p>MongoDB takes this a step further. This is a NoSQL database that allows you to program and query in Javascript.</p>

<p>There are a ton of development tools like Yeoman and Mean to help you take care of stuff.</p>

<p>So now we have a large part of the stack running with JS but its not yet Full Stack as per Red's definition</p>

<h2>Lets Go To The Metal</h2>

<p>The reason its not yet full stack boils down to the hardware. We don't yet program our microprocessors in Javascript. But that too is changing in a big way</p>

<p>http://pijs.io/ piJS is a project that allows you to program your Raspberry Pi in Javascript</p>
