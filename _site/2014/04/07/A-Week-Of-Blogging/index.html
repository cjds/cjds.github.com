<h1>A Week Of Blogging</h1>

<hr>
<p>I've been blogging every day for a week now, and have consequently found out a few things.</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>Writing an article is hard. Even if you know the subject matter, translating it into an explanation that everyone can understand takes ages.</li>
<li>It takes a lot longer than I thought to write a post. I thought writing a post might take an hour. Its more like three.</li>
<li>CSS is annoying. Being a perfectionist, setting up the CSS for the blog took at least half of my time. (even though I know it looks like I've done nothing)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Also blogging seems to be more as much about reading as it is about writing. Each post forced me to read a ton of other articles and documentation to check that my information was correct.</p>

<p>Among these,</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.swizec.com">A Geek With A Hat (Swizec Teller)</a> is a great blog by a programmer from Slovakia. His articles are generally mix of technical and non-technical. He's challenged himself to understand one academic paper every week for 52 weeks. You can read more about the challenge here.</p></li>
<li><p>The Knicker API's creator <a href="http://www.jeremybrooks.net">Jeremy Brooks</a> writes a blog here. His work on a Flickr API is also worth a look at.</p></li>
<li><p>Java SE 8 released on March 19. This fact was absolutely unbeknown to me until I read <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2109224/core-java/java-8-officially-arrives-at-last.html">this delightful article</a> about the new features it incorporates. (I also was reading about <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2078598/java-se/project-jigsaw-delayed-until-java-9.html">Project Jigsaw</a> and Java SE 9)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.mkyong.com/">Mkyong</a> is an old popular programmers blog for and by programmers. Learned a lot from there for my article about Maven. But he is a great resource about a lot of things.</p></li>
<li><p>I also read <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.in/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html">this brilliant article</a> describing the flaws in the Java Method of programming. Its length is worth it. :-)</p></li>
<li><p>Also for my work on a Song in Pictures I was inspired by Luke Beard's project, <a href="http://www.alyricaday.com">A Lyric A Day</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
